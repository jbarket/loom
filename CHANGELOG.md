# Changelog

All notable changes to loom are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

Work toward v0.4 — see [docs/v0.4-architecture.md](docs/v0.4-architecture.md)
for the full arc. This alpha is the first piece.

## [0.4.0-alpha.1] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- Harness manifest block (`harnesses/<client>.md`) — per-harness
  descriptor (tool prefixes, delegation primitive, scheduling,
  session search, gotchas). Loaded by `identity()` when
  `LOOM_CLIENT` resolves. Matches stack spec v1 §4.7.
- Model manifest block (`models/<model>.md`) — per-model-family
  descriptor (capability notes, workarounds, when-to-use /
  when-not-to-use). Loaded by `identity()` when `LOOM_MODEL`
  resolves. Matches stack spec v1 §4.8.
- Procedures block (`procedures/*.md`) — procedural-identity docs
  with a hard cap of ~10 files. Reader ships; populated content
  lands in a later alpha. Matches stack spec v1 §4.9.
- `LOOM_MODEL` environment variable + optional `model` param on the
  `identity` tool.
- `LOOM_STACK_VERSION` file at the context-dir root, auto-stamped
  with `1` on server boot. `createLoomServer` refuses to start
  against a stack version ahead of what this loom understands.
- Missing-manifest nudges: when `LOOM_CLIENT` or `LOOM_MODEL` is set
  but no corresponding manifest exists, `identity()` emits a
  template-filled section telling the agent exactly what to write.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-19

Initial public release.

### Added

- `SqliteVecBackend` — single-file memory store using
  [`better-sqlite3`](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3) plus
  the [`sqlite-vec`](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec) vec0 virtual
  table. One `memories.db` per agent. Real cosine similarity.
- `FastEmbedProvider` — embeddings via
  [`fastembed`](https://github.com/Anush008/fastembed-js) with
  BGE-small-en-v1.5 (384-dim, ~33MB ONNX, CPU-only). First run
  downloads the model to `~/.cache/loom/fastembed/`. No GPU, no
  Docker, no daemon.
- Stack specification — [`docs/loom-stack-v1.md`](docs/loom-stack-v1.md)
  defines the directory layout, block types, memory schema, wake
  sequence, and adapter contract that v0.4 work builds on.

### Changed

- Memory backend is now a single opinionated stack (sqlite-vec +
  fastembed). The env-driven backend selector is gone.

### Removed

- Qdrant backend, Ollama embedding provider, OpenAI embedding
  provider, filesystem backend. None were load-bearing for the new
  stack and all added external-service dependencies or operational
  overhead.
